# **Twins?**

For years I have heard a saying used to describe two people, usually guys, who are so much alike they are said to be "twin brothers from a different mother." Of course this is a silly term because twins are by definition from the same mother.

I was thinking about this the other day about my Christian brothers and sisters. Aren't we truly twin brothers from a different mother? It is our Father, God, who makes us brothers. If we are Christlike then our characters are similar... Just like twins we have individual personalities but like family members there are similarities that let's one know we are related. 

Next time you hear a phrase like this "in the world" stop to look at it from a new perspective. It may surprise you how much the world has but don't have a clue because of their perspective.
